    <h2>Profile</h2>
     <blockquote style="width:642px">
       <p>My background within the Arts + Education has given me a wealth of knowledge within both learning + teaching. I feel this compliments my experience of working for many years within the highly competitive working styles of freelance development + music industry. I have experience in both CMS + LMS Consultancy. 8 years experience in the Higher Education Sector. I received a distinction for my MA in Interaction Design + Blended Collaboration. I have been a research assistant in fields of knowledge networks + economics of dematerialisation.<!-- 


       From an Arts background, I progressed through various mediums and then moved into curation, publishing and event coordination. Having grown up with computer and web technology, these strands have been interwoven from the beginning - naturally leading me into the exciting field of Technology Enhanced Learning.
     <br /> <br />
        I am an advocate of open source and try to promote digital authorship awareness. Been working in the cloud since 97. The internet allows a person to achieve at a high level in more than one field. --></p>

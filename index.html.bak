The        combined challenges have given me the tools to understand what is        appropriate for whom and at what level to approach educational        technology within a project. Facing Exeter University as the only point        of contact on the Cornwall Campus was politically complex and being the        only team member working at distance - communication was incredibly        important. The support required within the traditional subjects on offer        couldn't have been more complimentary to the Creative Arts subjects I        supported at University College Falmouth. The challenges within Art,        Design, Media &amp; Performance are far more about learning styles        (visual / movement) and various modes of delivery (Classroom / Studio,        Blended / Online). I have experience setting up and administering the        likes of Moodle but have also built additional tools to cater for the        needs of visual thinkers using other tools like Drupal. <br />        <br />        The type of content required to teach across these subjects range from        PDFs, Interactive Quizzes, Podcasts, Video, Lecture Capture<br />        <br />        From a background of Arts &amp; Education in contrast with my experience        of working within the freelance web development market and working the        music industry. I understand working in both small and large        organisations. I have a range of experience that equips me for <br />        <br />        I have experience in both CMS + LMS Consultancy. 8 years experience in        the Higher Education Sector. I received a distinction for my MA in        Interaction Design + Blended Collaboration. I have been a research        assistant in fields of knowledge networks + economics of        dematerialisation. From an Arts background, I progressed through various        mediums and then moved into curation, publishing and event coordination.        Having grown up with computer and web technology, these strands have        been interwoven from the beginning - naturally leading me into the        exciting field of Technology Enhanced Learning. <br />        <br />        I am an advocate of open source and try to promote digital authorship        awareness. Been working in the cloud since 97. The internet allows a        person to achieve at a high level in more than one field. <small>References
